# Deploy APIM Control Plane with APK

There are 3 components which you need to deploy to get the APK working with APIM. They are,

- [WSO2 API Manager 4.3.0](../control-plane/apim-deploy.md)
- [WSO2 APK Gateway 1.1.0](../control-plane/apk-deploy.md)
- [WSO2 APIM-APK Agent 1.1.0](../control-plane/apim-apk-agent-deploy.md)

## Next Steps

You can refer the [APK Control Plane Operations](../control-plane/control-plane-operations.md) guide to deploy APIs using the API Manager Control Plane with APK Gateway using APIM-APK Agent.
